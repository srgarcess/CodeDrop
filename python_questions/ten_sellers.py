Problem statement:
Weâ€™ve noticed that as items sell, their popularity increases due to social proof.
If the probability of selling changes to p = 0.3 + 0.02k,
where k is the number of users who previously sold an item.

How would you compute the expected number of successful sales
for the first 10 sellers of a particular product?

E[Si] = 0.3+0.02*E[Si-1] where E[Si] is the expected number of successful sales for the i-th seller.

This script calculates the expected number of successful sales for a given number of sellers.
