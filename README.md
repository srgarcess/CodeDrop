# 🚀 My Coding Solutions Repository
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to showcasing my coding solutions, programming challenges, and mini-projects!

# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a centralized hub for my work, primarily focusing on:

- Take-Home Assignments: Solutions to various coding challenges and assignments provided during interview processes or as part of online courses.

- Python Programming Questions: My approaches and solutions to common (and uncommon!) Python programming problems, often sourced from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or other coding interview preparation sites.

- **[WIP 👷🚧]** Mini-Projects: Small, self-contained applications or scripts developed to explore new technologies, reinforce concepts, or simply build something fun.

My intention is to provide clear, well-commented, and efficient solutions that demonstrate my problem-solving skills and coding practices.

# 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into logical directories to make navigation easy:

- `./takehome_tests/`: Contains subdirectories for each take-home assignment, typically including the problem statement (if permissible), my solution code, and any relevant documentation or tests.

- `./python_questions/`: Categorized solutions to Python programming questions. Each solution will usually reside in its own file, named descriptively.

- **[WIP 👷🚧]** `./mini_projects/`: Each mini-project will have its own dedicated directory, containing all necessary files (code, assets, README.md specific to the project, etc.).

# 🛠️ Technologies & Languages
The primary language used across this repository is Python. You might also find:

Specific libraries or frameworks relevant to individual projects (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).

# 🤝 How to Use/Navigate
Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/srgarcess/CodeDrop.git
cd CodeDrop
```
Explore Directories: Navigate into the `takehome_assignments`, `python_questions`, or `mini_projects` directories to find specific solutions or projects.

Run Solutions/Projects: Each solution or project will typically have comments or a dedicated `README.md` within its directory explaining how to run it, any dependencies, and expected output.
