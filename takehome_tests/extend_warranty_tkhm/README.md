# Questions

1. Please review the integrity of the data. Do you notice any data anomalies or idiosyncracies? If so, please describe them.

2. Calculate the attach rate overall and by merchant per month on a unit and dollar basis.

3. Which merchant industry would you focus business development on based on current attach rate and your views of market sizing? Assume we have roughly the same market penetration in each industry so
   that saturation is not a concern and assume net revenue to Extend is calculated by warranty sales \*
   (1-merchant cut). Please put together a 2 or 3 page PowerPoint (or Google Slides) presentation to the Extend executive team with your recommendation.

4. After exploring the data, define at least two questions you would be interested in exploring. Include 1 additional slide at the end of your PowerPoint presentation as "Next Steps" and at a minimum, supply:

- What the question is and why it matters for the business.
- What is the current data you have assembled makes you interested in the question.
- What additional data would you want to explore the question.
- At a high level, what you would do with the data to answer the question.
